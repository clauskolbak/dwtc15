dwtc15 - Templates
==================

Here's a couple of templates for rendering facets.

There are two versions of the templates. One compatible with Dynamicweb 8.6.1.X and another compatible with Dynamicweb 8.7.X.X.

The design of the templates comes from the Wrap solution, but can, of course, be adapted to any design.

Usage
-----

1. Open the product list template
2. Add `@IncludeFile("<relevant template>")` to the product list template
